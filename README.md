# C++ Advanced OpenGl techniques with shaders

This is a project to further work on techiques like frame buffer objects, stencil buffers, instancing, alpha blending while playing with shaders to create a scene.

Also optimization like only loading resources from Disk once and saving a reference to use it again if needed and making sure we only load the resources to the GPU once.
